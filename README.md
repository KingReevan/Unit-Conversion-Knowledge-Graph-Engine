# Unit Conversion Knowledge Graph Engine  
*A fully automated, LLM-powered system for discovering, validating, and storing unit conversions in a Neo4j knowledge graph.*

---

## Overview

This project builds an **autonomous unit-conversion engine** that continuously learns new unit-to-unit relationships using:

- **DSPy** for structured LLM pipelines  
- **OpenAI models** for generating questions & formulas  
- **Pydantic** for strict validation  
- **Neo4j** for graph storage  
- **AsyncIO & multithreading** for high-performance training  
- **Typer CLI** for user interaction  

The engine automatically:

1. Generates natural-language unit-conversion questions  
2. Extracts the pair of units (A → B)  
3. Asks an LLM for the mathematical conversion formula  
4. Stores forward + inverse relations in Neo4j  
5. Repeats the process autonomously for multiple cycles  

This produces a scalable **knowledge graph** of unit conversions.

## Core Features

### ✅ Automated Training Pipeline
- End-to-end question generation → unit extraction → formula derivation → graph storage  
- Fully asynchronous version available  
- Thread-parallelized DSPy predictions  

### ✅ LLM-Driven Formula Generation
Strict DSPy signatures guarantee:
- full unit names (no abbreviations)  
- strict math syntax (`*`, `/`, `**`)  
- minimal operations  
- target unit on the LHS  

### ✅ Neo4j Knowledge Graph
- Nodes represent units  
- Edges are typed as `CONVERTS_TO`  
- Automatic inverse formula generation  

### ✅ Reliable Validation
- Pydantic validates all extraction & formula outputs  
- Invalid LLM responses are gracefully skipped  

### ✅ Typer-Based CLI
Commands:
python cli.py train <cycles>
python cli.py async-train <cycles>
python cli.py ask
python cli.py shortest-path

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Create environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set API keys
Create a .env file with:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### 4. Run Neo4j
Make sure your Neo4j instance is running locally or remotely.

---

### Synchronous Training
Run:

```bash
python cli.py train 2
```

This performs:
- 2 training cycles
- 10 generated questions per cycle
- unit extraction
- formula generation
- graph storage

### Asynchronous Training
The async version is significantly faster due to:

- asyncio.gather for concurrent LLM calls
- asyncio.to_thread() for CPU-bound DSPy predictions
- async Neo4j writes

Run:

```bash
python cli.py async-train 4
```

## How the Async Pipeline Works
### 1. Async Question Generation
```python
await genq_async(...)
```

### 2. Parallel Unit Extraction
```python
await asyncio.gather(*unit_tasks)
```

### 3. Formula Generation in Threads
```python
asyncio.to_thread(ask_formula, from_unit, to_unit)
```

### 4. Async Neo4j Storage
```python
await save_all_conversions_async(formulas)
```

### Querying the Graph
Interactive mode:

```bash
python cli.py ask
```

Example:

```yaml
Ask anything: convert liters to milliliters
Result: liters → milliliters: milliliters = liters * 1000
```

### Graph Schema
Nodes
```css
(:Unit { name: "<full unit name>" })
```

Relationship
```css
(a:Unit)-[:CONVERTS_TO { formula: "<equation>" }]->(b:Unit)
```

Inverse Relations
Automatically computed via formula inversion and stored.

## Performance
- Async training is 4–10× faster
- DSPy unit extraction + formula generation supports multithreading
- Neo4j storage runs concurrently
- Execution time measured with @timeit

# Future Improvements
- Caching identical conversions
- Normalizing singular/plural unit representations
- Adding a web UI to explore the graph
- Automatic periodic training cycles
